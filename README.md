Cyber-Core

Proverbs 16:3
“Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.”

This repository contains the documentation for the participation of Cyber-Core in the
WRO Future Engineers 2025 competition. Our vehicle was designed by a Guatemalan team passionate about robotics.

We are a small team, but with a huge heart. We are only two, but together we form an unstoppable force driven by our passion for robotics and our desire to improve ourselves. Every step we take, every mistake we fix, and every achievement we make is the result of hard work, long hours, and unwavering trust between us and our Heavenly Father. We don’t have a large number, but we have something more powerful: trust in God, determination to never give up, and the certainty that with creativity and teamwork, we can achieve incredible things.
Because it’s not about how many we are… it’s about how much we believe in what we do.

Proverbs 2:6:

“For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.”

AGE: 17 YEARS

ROLE: Programming and component logistics

I am a student at Colegio Villa Real Atlántico 1, currently in fifth year of High School. For me, robotics represents a path of learning and self-improvement, where each project has allowed me to develop leadership, creativity, and confidence in my abilities, always working as a team to reach new goals.

Isaiah 43:2
“When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you.”

AGE: 15 YEARS

ROLE: Design and electronics

I am a student at Colegio Villa Real Atlántico 1, currently in 3rd year of Middle School, section B. For me, robotics is more than a subject: it is a space where I can express my creativity, learn from mistakes, and grow alongside my team. Through robotics, I have discovered that every challenge is an opportunity to improve, and that with dedication it is possible to turn ideas into real achievements.

Proverbs 16:9
“In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.”

MISSION

Our mission is to build, design, and program a vehicle capable of completing the variety of challenges in the competition. To make this possible, we used basic engineering principles, creativity, electronics, and many other functions that helped our vehicle look aesthetically appealing and work excellently.

As Colegio Villa Real Atlántico, we practice three values:

Love, necessary to solve the problems we face as a team;

Discipline, one of the most important values for the project to be carried out successfully;

Excellence, because every small effort brings us closer to our goal.

We want to show that robotics and automation are not just tools of the future, but present opportunities to build a smarter, more accessible, and more sustainable world from the perspective of young people with vision and passion for engineering.

Philippians 4:13
“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”

VISION

Our vision is to become a team capable of leading with love, discipline, and excellence in the field of robotics and technology, showcasing our values and honoring our Creator, our God. We aim to be an example of how the combination of faith, creativity, discipline, technical knowledge, and teamwork can lead to innovations that inspire future generations of students, engineers, and technology enthusiasts.

We want to go beyond a competition. We seek to leave a mark as two people who dare to imagine, design, and build technologies with real impact. We envision a future in which our experience and creations become a foundation for new generations passionate about technology and innovation.

Joshua 1:9
“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”

CHALLENGE

The WRO Future Engineers challenge encourages students to develop design, innovation, and teamwork skills through the construction and programming of autonomous vehicles. This challenge not only tests creativity and precision, but also the ability to solve real-world problems using technology. More than a competition, it represents an opportunity to grow, share knowledge, and get closer to the world of robotics.

Designed To:

Detect and avoid obstacles

Follow track lines autonomously

Recognize track signs or markers

Adapt to route changes

Maintain stability and precision

Complete the course in the shortest time possible

Proverbs 22:29
“Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.”

CAR SUMMARY

Our vehicle has been developed to move completely autonomously, without human intervention during its operation. Its functionality is based on cameras and neural networks, allowing it to make intelligent real-time decisions depending on the environment it perceives through computer vision.

Stage 1 – Color Guidance (Blue and Orange)

In the first stage, the autonomous vehicle uses the front camera to capture images and recognize the colored lines marking the path. An AI model processes the sequence of blue and orange stripes:

If the first detected stripe is orange, the system turns right.

If the blue stripe appears first, the vehicle turns left.

This behavior comes from prior training with many examples of colors, trajectories, and actions, resulting in flexible and accurate driving.

Stage 2 – Obstacle Detection and Avoidance (Red and Green Cubes)

In the second stage, the system encounters obstacles represented by red or green cubes. Using computer vision:

If the obstacle is red, the vehicle turns right.

If the obstacle is green, it turns left to avoid it.

Thanks to neural networks and color segmentation, the model achieves precise detection and real-time response, enabling safer navigation.

Stage 3 – Autonomous Parking (Pink Boards Area)

The final stage requires automatic parking inside a designated area outlined by pink boards. Here, the system combines computer vision and motion control to position itself accurately and complete the course fully autonomously.

Ecclesiastes 4:9
“Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.”

VEHICLE ASSEMBLY

In the first assembly phase, two rectangular plates of 7 × 20 cm were fabricated. These were joined with 2-inch metal spacers to create a solid two-level structure that improved component distribution.

On the lower front part, the steering mechanism was installed, providing directional movement. On the lower rear part, the transmission was mounted to deliver the necessary propulsion. This layout improves stability and weight distribution.

On the first level, the Raspberry Pi board was installed as the central processor. On the second level, 18650 batteries were mounted to supply power. Next to them, the Arduino board and its shield were installed to handle sensor communication and low-level control.

This two-level organization allowed optimal use of space, proper separation of power and control modules, reduced interference, and facilitated maintenance of the prototype.
