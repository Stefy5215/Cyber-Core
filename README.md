WRO FUTURE ENGINEERS 2025

This project was developed for the WRO Future Engineers 2025 competition, aiming to design an autonomous robot capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles based on their color by applying computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques.

The robot uses cameras to capture visual information from its surroundings, which is then processed through neural networks trained to identify specific colors associated with different types of obstacles. Depending on the detected color, the robot decides in real time which evasive maneuver to execute.

The software has been developed in Python, utilizing specialized libraries for image processing, model training, and autonomous motion control.

In addition to software development, the robot’s structural design was optimized to ensure stability, quick response, and precision in turns. Automatic calibration routines were also implemented to adjust detection parameters based on lighting conditions, improving the robot’s robustness in variable environments.

This project reflects a combination of advanced programming, machine learning, and robotic control, developed collaboratively and empathetically by our team, always valuing teamwork, creativity, and shared learning.
